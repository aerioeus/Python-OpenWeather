# Parsing XML using Python

This repository contains a Python program to make API calls to http://openweathermap.org/ and parse JSON data. In this example, we query some common weather information such as current temperature, minimum and maximum temperature from the JSON data and print the information.

Make sure to obtain a valid API key from http://openweathermap.org/ and replace the `xxx...` in Python-OpenWeather.py with the valid one.
